# IMDb Movie Recommendation System 🎥

Welcome to the **IMDb Movie Recommendation System**, an interactive project that demonstrates my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and web development. This system leverages the IMDb dataset to suggest movies similar to a user-selected title, providing a seamless user experience with an interactive interface.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests movies based on similarity metrics.
2. **Interactive User Interface:** Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), offering a clean and responsive design.
3. **Dynamic Movie Posters:** Fetches posters via The Movie Database (TMDb) API for a visually appealing experience.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Streamlit for web deployment
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Requests
- **API:** TMDb API for movie posters
- **Dataset:** IMDb movie data
- **Visualization:** Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Cleaned and prepared IMDb data for use.
   - Calculated a similarity matrix using cosine similarity to capture relationships between movies.

2. **Recommendation Algorithm:** 
   - Recommends movies based on similarity to a user-selected movie.
   - Dynamic fetching of movie posters enhances the user experience.

3. **Streamlit App:**
   - Simple dropdown to select a movie.
   - Displays recommended titles with posters for better visualization.

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IMDb-Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd IMDb-Movie-Recommendation-System
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Note:
You will need an API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie posters. Replace the placeholder API key in `app.py` with your own.
